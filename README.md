# README 'themeltspice.sh'
> A color theme handler for the OSX version of the circuit simulator LTSpice.

## Introduction

This is not meant to be an introduction to either the usage or function of 
the electric circuit simulator **LTSpice** for neither OSX nor Windows. 
It is instead assumed you have basic knowledge of the OSX version of this simulator.

**Note:** This theme manager is unique to OSX and will not in any shape or form work 
on a Windows Machine. Instead see 
[Windows **LTSpice** theme manager](https://github.com/sakabug/LTspice-themes/blob/main/LTspice-themes.txt) 
if you are looking for a Windows theme manager.

This script is used to create and set a color theme for the OSX version of LTSpice. 
The themes are stored as a plain text file in an human readable and pretty obvious format 
(see the BNF grammar at the end of this README file).

While **LTSpice** does not inherently support any concept of a color theme the color settings
are stored in an OSX standard plist configuration file that can be updated outside
the **LTSpice** program.

&nbsp;

**A note on the OSX version of LTSpice:** 

While much or all of the core funtionality of the simulator are exctly the same
between the OSX and Windows versions the UI is dramatically different. In fact,
many OSX users are so stumped by the apparent frugality of the OSX UI that they
end up using the Windows version even on OSX by running it under Wine. 
This is a mistake (and quite slow and clonky)

While the OSX version does not adhere to the ususal design guidelines for OSX programs
and requires some "getting used to" 
it is a highly functional UI for its purpose. After the initial "getting-used-to" experience more than a few users claim that the OSX version is superior for professionals 
or even serious amateurs compared to the windows version. This is mainly to do with 
the abondonment of menus that distract the user and forces eye-focus to shift.

Both the advantage and the drawback of the OSX UI is that it heavily relies on the user 
getting familiar and learning around 8 or 9 keystrokes. Once those keystrokes are
mastered it is usually substantially faster to create a diagram and setup a simulation
in the native OSX version than the Windows dito.

&nbsp; 

**Why do this as a bash shell script?**

Why oh why was this done as a bash shell script I can hear people cry out. 
Couldn't it be written in [select favourite language] (e.g. Python). Of course it could. However, bash is the lowest common denominator that doesn't require any dependencies and the guiding principle of this has been that it should run out of the box. 
I did not want to run into "module-hell" of Python. Instead I claim it is perfectly possible to write readable, medium-complex programs using bash. It is of course not without its limitation since bash code can be almost unreadable when one uses all the features availaable that are not commonly known. If you stick to some good design principles (and modularization) it is perfectly readable and maintainable. Just like any language.
If you envision a program with more than around 600-800 lines of manually written code  then bash might not be your first choice. Especially not for the very old version of bash that default ship with OSX (v3.2.57). A lot has happened since that was release well over a decade ago.

So why not write it as a ```zsh``` script? It would be perfectly fine to convert the few bash:ism used to ```zsh``` 
and it might very well be a good idea. But having written bash scripts for a long (long) time it was simply quicker than working around some particulars that differs in zsh that I'm not totally up to speed on.

&nbsp;

**Related work**

The inspiration for this work comes from the [Windows **LTSpice** theme manager](https://github.com/sakabug/LTspice-themes/blob/main/LTspice-themes.txt). While this implementation is widely different in both function, form and implementation the drive to write this came out of friendly *"jealousy"* that the windows world had this but not the OSX world. This state of affairs cannot stand! 

&nbsp;

# Installation

There is no installation program for this since it is only one executable script file and you are free to place that file anywhere at your conveniance. 

To use the script either copy the script (```themeltspice.sh```) to some standard location for scripts as per your ```PATH``` variable or create a new directory and copy the file there and run it from this directory.

The script uses the default location of "```~/.ltspice_themes```" to store the theme file as well as a backup file of **LTSpice** original plst file when you first run the theme script. If the directory does not exist it will be created the first time you run the script. If no theme file exist a default theme file with the **LTSpice** "default" theme will be created.

In the distribution there is a default theme file "```themes.ltt```". The file-extension can be read as "**LT**Spice **T**hemes". By using the "-f" option you can also specify another file location to be used a theme file. This default file contains (as of this writing) these 5 themes:

1. default (LTSpice default)
2. sakabug
3. twilight-after-dawn
4. dracula
5. softdark

Themes no 2-4 are taken from the Windows cousin of theme manager (See related work above), "softdark" is a dfferent theme I personally like to use. If you want to use this theme file just copy it manully to the "```~/.ltspice_themes```" directory.

Later on if you find themes you like somewhere else just open the theme file and copy them at the end with one blank line between the new theme and the last existing theme.

> **WARNING!** The format of the OSX and Windows version of the theme files are not compatible since the developer of **LTSpice** have used different names for the control fields in the Windows and the OSX version.

## Known Limitations

- It is not (yet) possible to remove or overwrite an existing theme. For that you have to first manually delete the theme you want to overwrite in the themes file.
- Windows theme files are not compatible with OSX and vice versa. *C'est la vie!*

&nbsp;

# Usage

```
Set or create a named color theme for LTSpice
Usage:
%themeltspice.sh [-f <FILE>] [-d] [-l] [-h] [<THEME>]
-d          : Dump current plist to default or named theme file as specified theme
-f <FILE>   : Use the specified file as theme file
-h          : Print help and exit
-l [<NAME>] : List themes in default or named theme file or Ã­f <NAME> 
              is specified check if <NAME> theme exists
-p          : List content in **LTSpice** plist file
-q          : Quiet no status output
```

There are two major use cases:

1. Set a new theme to be used the next time **LTSpice** is run
2. Save an existing color configuration you have made as a new theme

In addition to these major use cases there are some supporting function that are available

- List the names of all defined themes in a specific themes file
- Check if a specified theme esists
- Print the **LTSpice** binary configuration file in a human readable format

&nbsp;

> Note: A copy fo the original **LTSpice** plist configuration file is also stored in the theme directory with the extension ```*.ORIGINAL```. In case (for some reason) the configuration file gest corrupt you can always restore a clean backup.

&nbsp;

## Setting a new theme

If we assume you have installed the script somewhere in your path and copied the distrbuted theme file "```themes.ltt```" to the theme directory (see Installation section above) you can now set the ```softdark```theme as so

```
$> themeltspice softdark
Successfully updated new theme to 'softdark'
$> _
``` 

This will update the current **LTSpice** configuration file with this color schema. To restore back to the default schema just do

```
$> themeltspice default
Successfully updated new theme to 'default'
$> _
``` 

and there is nothing more to it. The settings are done in an atomic way so a change go through totally successfull or not at all. This way you cannot end up with a half-updated configuration file.

&nbsp;

> Atomic update: The way this is done is by first copying the config file to a temporary directory, do the changes, run a integrity verification on the config file and then copy it back to the application location (i.e. ```/Users/<USER>/Library/Preferences/com.analog.LTspice.App.plist)```)

&nbsp;

## Storing the current configuration as a theme

By first creating a color schema in **LTSpice** it can then be saved as a new theme. So if you want to store your current settings as the new theme, say, "```mytheme```" you use the "```-d```" (=dump) option as such

```
$> themeltspice -d mytheme
Dumping current color setup from 'com.analog.LTspice.App.plist' to '/Users/<USER>/.ltspice_themes/themes.txt' as theme 'mytheme'
$> _
```

This will store the new theme at the end of the existing theme file. If a theme with this name already exsts an error message will be printed informing about this.

## Listing all themes available

To see a list of all themes defined use the "```-l```" option as

```
$> themeltspice -l 
Listing themes in '/Users/<USER>/.ltspice_themes/themes.txt''
 1. default
 2. sakabug
 3. twilight-after-dawn
 4. dracula
 5. softdark
$> _
```

### Checking if a named theme exists

Use the '```-l```' option with a theme name

```
$> themeltspice.sh -l mytheme
*** ERROR *** Theme 'mytheme' DOESN'T exists in '/Users/<USER>/.ltspice_themes/themes.ltt'
```

or

```
$> themeltspice.sh -l default
Theme 'default' exists in '/Users/ljp/.ltspice_themes/themes.ltt'
```


## Printing all settings stored in the config file

To see the complete configuration file (and not only the color settings) use the "```-p```" (=print) that will dump the applications full property list file to stdout as in

```
$> themeltspice -p
'/Users/<USER>/Library/Preferences/com.analog.LTspice.App.plist' content:{
  "AllowShortedCompPins" => 0
  "AutoDotRawDeletion" => 1

  ...

  "WaveColor11" => 12237492
  "WaveColor12" => 255
  "WaveColor13" => 16748287
}
$> _
```
&nbsp;

# How the script works

The configuration file where the **LTSpice** configurations are stored
is a binary configuration file and cannot be directly manipulated. The format
used is a standard OSX *"Property List"* (plist) and as such OSX provides a
command line tool that can be used to manipuate the individual fields in that
property file.

The OSX utility is called '```plutil```' and is used to read and manipulate individual 
fields in this configuration file. See ```man plutil``` for more details.

By default the plist configuration file of **LTSpice** is stored at:

    /Users/<USER>/Library/Preferences/com.analog.LTspice.App.plist

Since **LTSpice** updates this file at least on every exit the simulator must be closed before
running this script. This is also checked in the script and an error message is shown
if any running copies are detected. 

As an extra precaution the first time the script is run it creates a backup copy of the
configuration file and stores it in the theme directory with the added suffix 
"```.ORIGINAL```".

Since OSX caches all plist files it is not enough to just update the property file
on its own, one must also force a refresh of the propert cash using "```defalt read <PLIST-FILE>```" command. 


## Directories and files used

- [```/User/<USER>/.ltspice_themes/themes.ltt```]  
The default location of themes

- [```/User/<USER>/.ltspice_themes/com.analog.LTspice.App.plist.ORIGINAL```]  
Copy of the **LTSpice** application plist file at the time of first run 

- [```/Users/<USER>/Library/Preferences/com.analog.LTspice.App.plist```]  
**LTSpice* application plist file

# Theme file format

For each theme a total of 34 color parameters are stored as listed in figure 1 below. 

> **Difference between OSX the Windows version theme format:**  
Unfortunately there are three minor differences between the Windows version and OSX version theme files in that some fields have different names in the two versions.  
There are three major differences:  
--OSX uses the name "```GridColor```" while the windows version simply call it "```Grid```".  
--OSX uses the name "```InActiveAxisColor```" while the windows version simply call it "```InActiveAxis```".  
--The window version have a "```SchematicColor13```" which doesn't exist in the OSX version.  
For this reason it is not possible to copy theme directly between the Windows and OSX without som manual fixes.

## BNF Grammar
The BNF grammar for the theme file is extremely simple as shown in Figure 1 below

```
themes    ::= theme | theme <EMPTY_LINE> themes
theme     ::= '[' theme-name ']' <NL> fields
fields    ::= field | field <NL> fields
field     ::= fieldname '=' digits
fieldname ::= "" | alnum fieldname
alnum     ::= "A" | "B" | ...
digits    ::= "0" | "1" | ...
 ```
